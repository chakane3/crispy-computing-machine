This JHP bullet\u2019s jacket is not only shaped to facilitate feeding in a semi-auto, but also to promote wide and rapid terminal expansion. The rim of its nose cavity also features long notches, each of which deliberately weakens the jacket to shape extremely uniform mushrooming.

The bullet\u2019s jacket fortifies it against catching in a feeding mechanism or deforming under the stress of ignition, and also lets it leave less lead residue behind in a firearm\u2019s barrel. Blazer\u2019s FMJ is extra nice because its base is protected by its jacket. This prohibits hot propellant gasses from cooking and evaporating the bullet\u2019s lead core, promoting a healthier training environment \u2013 particularly indoors, where the ventilation ain\u2019t so good.\n\r\nNo surprises here: Brass label ammo features new production brass cases, which shooters like for their tendency to keep an action cleaner than aluminum could have, as well as their suppleness which permits handloading. Blazer uses CCI\u2019s Boxer primers, which are sensitive and non-corrosive, and loads consistent charges of propellant to promote steady muzzle velocities. This round\u2019s 1,145 fps muzzle velocity was recorded out of a 4\u201d barrel, same length as a Glock 19 or Walther PPQ M2.

This nickel treatment makes feeding and ejection almost seamless for dependable function with each trigger pull. The casing is crimped to a hollow-point projectile that weighs in at 147 grains; this is a common heavyweight in the 9x19mm caliber and offers deep penetration, effective energy transfer, and subsonic muzzle velocity for compatibility with silencers.   \r\nSpeer\u2019s Gold Dot G2 hollow-point bullet is made by permanently bonding copper plating to a lead core. This results in a projectile that resists splintering and shedding for ultimate weight retention during entry into a target. As the bullet travels into a threat, its hollow cavity promotes wide expansion which slows the bullet and allows its energy to ruin internal organs and arteries. The G2 revision adds elastomer to the hollow cavity which resists clogging from leather and denim in order to preserve the bullet\u2019s wounding capacity no matter what barriers it passes through. \r\nSpeer Gold Dot rounds are often used by federal law enforcement agencies due to their low flash and street-proven record for lethality.

Generally, the Shooting Dynamics ammo line-up carries a cheaper price than the Exacta line-up so you get more range time for your buck.\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard of Fiocchi, the company itself has a long and proud history of manufacturing some of the best ammunition money can buy. The company started in the early 1800\u2019s near the Italian city of Bologna, which was a thriving industrial hub at the time. A man named Guilio Fiocchi became a bank manager and oversaw a loan made to a black powder manufacturer in Lecco, a small city northwest of Milan, Italy.\nAs you probably could have guessed after seeing Guilio\u2019s last name, that black powder manufacturer defaulted on the loan. In due time, Guilio Fiocchi got in touch with his brother, Giacomo and they started their own ammunition business. It didn\u2019t take long for Fiocchi to put Italy on the map of recreational shooters in the United States by producing some of the finest ammunition for rifles and shotguns you can find.\nMost Fiocchi rounds are made in Ozark, Missouri, including the majority of their 300 BLK ammo. These rounds are packaged in a single box, containing 50 rounds of 300 Blackout.

Their ADI World Class subsidiary also produces match grade 300 AAC Blackout ammo, so you can do some world-class shooting with your AR-15 rifle.\n\r\nThis cartridge actually features one of America\u2019s best projectiles: the MatchKing, by Sierra. The round\u2019s 125 grain hollow point* bullet made two trips across the Pacific just so it could treat you to stellar accuracy.\n\r\nThe MatchKing\u2019s jacket is drawn to a concentricity standard of \u00b10.0003\" in maximum variation. At that scale, any flaw in concentricity is virtually nonexistent. The MatchKing\u2019s weight is also held to a standard of \u00b10.3 grains, and its core is perfectly distributed because it is so seamlessly contoured to the jacket\u2019s interior geometry. This particular MatchKing also features a flat base instead of a boat tail, which offers the most consistent surface for propellant gasses to push against.\n\r\nADI World Class engineered this round\u2019s propellant specifically for optimal performance in the 300 AAC Blackout cartridge. Its match grade brass case is manufactured in-house, and it is annealed so it can perfectly conform to the chamber during ignition.\n\n*Although technically a hollow point, the MatchKing is not designed for terminal expansion and is not ideal for hunting medium-sized game.

It can\u2019t break the sound barrier to make a sharp cracking sound, although you\u2019re probably going to notice so slow a bullet follows a markedly steep trajectory if you fire it over longer distances.\n\r\nThe bullet itself is inherently accurate, however. As an open tip it features a concentric copper jacket with a very small aperture in its nose. Winchester injected molten lead through the opening so it would cool in place without forming gaps or voids that could impact in-flight rotational stability. The bullet\u2019s flat base creates a consistent, level surface for propellant gas to push against, and because the bullet\u2019s base is fully encapsulated by its jacket it doesn\u2019t let lead evaporate to deposit residue on the bore\u2019s rifling or a suppressor\u2019s baffles.\n\r\nThis American-made 300 Blackout round\u2019s accurate bullet is seated in the mouth of a new production brass case, with a non-corrosive Boxer primer for even cleaner performance and the option to reload after the range day has ended.

Antimony content does make lead less dense, but in return it hardens it considerably. The pellets won\u2019t get crushed under pressure, which preserves their ability to fly straight and pattern tight. (Softer pellets which can deform as they penetrate muscle tissue don\u2019t offer any advantage when you\u2019re shooting clays anyway.) And because #9 shot is so small, even 3/4 ounces of it contains a whopping 439 pellets.\n\r\nThe Italian shotshell expert carefully pairs their shot with their own components, which they manufacture from raw materials to ensure their consistency. 209 primers tend to reliable ignition, after which fast-burning powder tends to reliable propulsion. NobelSport\u2019s wads enhance pattern density, and their hulls are reloadable!    \n", "type": "shotgun"}, {"name": "32 Gauge - Mixed Manufacturer - 25 Rounds", "price": "15.00", "caliber": "32 Gauge Ammo Shells", "link": "https://www.luckygunner.com/32-gauge-mixed-manufacturer-25-rounds", "imgURL": "https://cdn-secure.luckygunner.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/420x420/eb6f4b3ae1db897855c071b7a6b629b0/8/_/8_3.jpg", "description": "\n\n        We come darn near close to perfect, but who doesn\u2019t make a mistake once in a while? Sometimes we accept ammo into our warehouse that has damaged packaging but is in otherwise in perfect condition. Sometimes we damage the packaging ourselves. But either way, we know just what to do with it: seal it up in 25-round bags and offer low-priced variety packs!\n\r\nHere is what we can tell you about these 32 Gauge shotshells: they are as good as new and should function correctly in any 32 Gauge shotgun.\n\r\nHere is what we cannot tell you about these shotshells: what size shot they are loaded with, whether they are loaded with lead or steel shot, and which companies manufactured them. We really want to emphasize that this is a truly random assortment of 32 Gauge ammo. You could get 25 different shotshells; you could get 25 identical shotshells.

Times like these call for the little 32 Gauge shotshell, which can be hard to find unless you\u2019re smart and know about Lucky Gunner.\n\r\nThis 2-1/2\u201d shell harbors a lightweight 1/2 ounce column of shot. #8 shot is fairly small to help prevent destroying a trophy, although this game load ought to serve well for trap as well. Each 0.09\u201d diameter pellet is round and made of hard lead to promote more efficient patterning, and the shell\u2019s 1,260 fps muzzle velocity promotes a flat trajectory with short lead times.\n\r\nAlthough they\u2019re headquartered in snowy Minnesota, Federal actually imports this ammo from Italy. It still exhibits Federal\u2019s consistent quality thanks to its brass-plated steel heads which go easy on a classic shotgun, low fouling powder, reliable primers and one-piece wads. Reloadable hulls are a must for any hunter who prefers harder-to-find ammo like 32 Gauge!    \n", "type": "shotgun"}]}
