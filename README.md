Welcome to ammoFinder. Here you'll find the scripts i used to scrape web data from several websites (currently at 2 sites)<br>
This can be used as an api to return json files regarding: caliber, price, type, name, etc.<br>
You can also enjoy an iOS adaptation to this project as well<br>
Soon I will be working on a web version as well<br>
